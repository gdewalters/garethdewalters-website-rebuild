## Essential apps

This site is published in Auckland, New Zealand using the [Eleventy static site generator](https://www.11ty.dev)

I'm not a frontend designer, so this site's theme is based on the Once theme. I'm working on [something more custom](/rebuild/) in the background.

This site is produced using:

- [Bear](https://bear.app)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)
- [Pixelmator Pro](https://www.pixelmator.com/pro/)
- [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com)

The site logo (did I mention I'm not a graphic designer either?) incorporates the gules (red) three chevronels argent (silvery white) from the flag of Glamorgan (yn Gymraeg: Baner Morgannwg). That design was in turn taken from the arms of Iestyn ap Gwrgant, the last independent ruler of Glamorgan â€“ the region where many of my Welsh family comes from.

## Code and server set-up

I use [Git](https://git-scm.com) for version control, [Github to store the repository](https://github.com/gdewalters/garethdewalters-website), and [Netlify]() for website hosting.
